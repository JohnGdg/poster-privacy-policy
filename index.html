      Career and Technical Education high school in Las Vegas, Nevada.
    </p>
    <p>

      of licensed personnel designated by the school to publish content to CTTA’s official
      Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin business account.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Information we collect and process</h2>
    <h3>Content entered by administrators and licensed personnel</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Post text and captions;</li>
      <li>Selected images and videos to include in posts;</li>
      <li>Selected platforms (Facebook and/or Instagram);</li>
      <li>Scheduled dates and times for publishing;</li>
      <li>Optional hashtags selected from a preset list.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Timestamps for scheduling and publishing;</li>
      <li>Temporary URLs for media files stored in Firebase Storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What we do <em>not</em> collect</h3>

      <li>No student login information;</li>
      <li>No parent or visitor accounts or passwords;</li>
      <li>No direct collection of student grades, discipline records, or other education records;</li>
      <li>No tracking of visitors who view CTTA’s posts on Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. How we use information</h2>
    <p>
      Information entered into Poster is used only for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preparing and scheduling social media posts for CTTA’s official pages;</li>
      <li>Uploading media to cloud storage so that Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin can access it;</li>
      <li>Managing drafts and scheduled posts for CTTA staff.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell or license any information processed by Poster to third parties.
      We do not use Poster data for targeted advertising or profiling of students, parents, or visitors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>

    <h3>Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and Linkedin</h3>
    <p>
      Poster uses the Meta (Facebook) Graph API to publish content to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The CTTA Facebook Page; and</li>
      <li>The associated Instagram business account.and Linkedin account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When an administrator or licensed staff member publishes a post, the text and media are sent to Meta and Linkedin so that they can
      appear on CTTA’s official social media channels. All such use is subject to Meta’s and Linkedin's own
      Terms of Service and Data Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>Firebase Storage (Google)</h3>
    <p>
      Poster uses Google Firebase Storage to temporarily store media files (such as photos) so that
      they can be published to Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Media is uploaded from the administrator’s or licensed staff member’s device to Firebase Storage.</li>
      <li>Media is then referenced from Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin when creating posts.</li>
      <li>
        After a post has been successfully published, Poster normally deletes the related media
        files from Firebase Storage. For scheduled posts, media is retained only until the
        scheduled time so the post can be published, and is then deleted.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Post text and scheduling information are stored only on administrators’ and licensed personnel’s devices
          and within the CTTA Facebook, Instagram and Linkedin accounts once published.</li>
      <li>
        Media files uploaded to Firebase Storage are kept only as long as reasonably necessary
        to prepare and publish posts (including waiting for scheduled posts), after which
        Poster normally deletes the files from Firebase Storage.
      </li>
      <li>Published posts remain on CTTA’s Facebook Page, Instagram and Linkedin account until CTTA removes
          or archives them.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Poster is an internal tool for CTTA staff and is not intended for use by children.
      Students and parents do not log in to or interact with Poster directly. Any images or
      references to students published via Poster appear only as part of CTTA’s normal
      school communications on its official social media pages.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Access to Poster is limited to a small number of authorized CTTA administrators and licensed personnel
      designated by the school. Devices using Poster should be secured by the staff who use them.
      CTTA relies on Firebase and Meta’s security controls for storage and delivery of content.
